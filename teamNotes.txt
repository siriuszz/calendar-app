Git Quick Summary: 
*Pull from origin master to get the latest changes that are ready to go.

*Push to YOUR master branch (Ex: chance-master).  Then create a manual merge request on the Github website into the Github branch: ("testing")

*Git Master will merge branch: "testing" into the branch: "master"


Longer Explanation:

*Before you start: [ git pull origin master ]
    -this will pull in the latest changes to the code and insure you are working off the latest working version of the code.  
    -this should not cause any conflicts, but if it does STOP and communicate w/ Git Master (unless you know whose code is in conflict w/ yours).  Resolve conflict. 
    -*It's a good idea to do: [ git branch ] to make sure you are on the right branch and pulling in updates to the branch you intend to work off of 

*Checkout a branch to work on a new feature using [git checkout -b nameOfYourBranch ]
    -This will put you on the branch you just created with all the code from your last branch (you should always commit before moving branches).  This essentially creates a copy of the the branch that you just left from the point you just left it.  
    -We create multiple branches because it makes it very easy to go back to a point in time, when you KNOW your code was working correctly.  Also, it's a pretty convenient place to push you code to the rest of the team--when your new feature is working.  Though, use your best judgment of when to push (smaller code pushes are better than large ones)
    -Work on your code as you normally would--committing often.  

*Work on the branch you intend work on as usual.  When you finish a feature
